## Hi friend, I'm Jennifer! 👋 🌈 👩‍💻
My name is Jennifer and I'm a fullstack dev with a passion for open source. 🥳 

### 😄 Pronouns
She/Her/They/Them

### 🤔 Who am I? 
A little bit about me, I have four wonderful cats, two oranage and two grey [Quill 🐱,Lavender 🐈‍⬛, Atlas 🐱, Asteria 🐈‍⬛] 
Only slightly less intresting than my cats is the fact I hold two master’s degrees, one in Computer Science and the other in Business Administration with a focus on Project Management. I'm an avid tea drinker 🍵 and a big fan of taking train rides 🚂.

I believe it's creativity and hard work that drive the world to new solutions, what may not seem possible today is tomorrow's break through. We as people are always learning and should strive to improve not just ourselves but those around us. I live for those ‘ah ha!’ moments when the code clicks into place and you excitedly fist bump the air.

When I'm not directly programming, I'm off teaching at my [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/) group! I am excited about sharing my knowledge and experience with those wanting to learn.

Fun fact I'm really into playing board games and have been running an on going Dungeons & Dragons game for 10+ years.
